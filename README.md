We use statistical hypothesis testing to determine which of our hypotheses are most likely to be true. There are two types of statistical hypothesis:
* The null hypothesis is also known as H0 and is generally the hypothesis that can be explained by random chance.
* The alternate hypothesis is also known as Ha and is generally the hypothesis that is influenced by non-random events.


Hypothesis Testing in Five Steps
Regardless of the complexity of the dataset or the proposed question, hypothesis testing uses the same five steps:

Generate a null hypothesis, its corresponding alternate hypothesis, and the significance level.
Identify a statistical analysis to assess the truth of the null hypothesis.
Compute the p-value using statistical analysis.
Compare p-value to the significance level.
Reject (or fail to reject) the null hypothesis and generate the conclusion.
