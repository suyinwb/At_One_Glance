We use statistical hypothesis testing to determine which of our hypotheses are most likely to be true. There are two types of statistical hypothesis:
* The null hypothesis is also known as H0 and is generally the hypothesis that can be explained by random chance.
* The alternate hypothesis is also known as Ha and is generally the hypothesis that is influenced by non-random events.
